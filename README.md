# polyBoard
Snowboard game made in unity for windows

Instrunctions to Play:
once downloaded all files you will need to unzip UnityPlay.zip
also unzip 2 files in moutain_Data -> Managed.zip and Plugin.zip

after that you should be able to play polyBoard by running mountain.

There are bugs that i am aware of like being able to ride upside down but feel free to try out my simple game.
